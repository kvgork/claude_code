# Claude Code - Learning System

A comprehensive **teaching-first** command and agent system for Claude Code, designed for learning programming and robotics concepts through guided discovery.

## 🎯 Philosophy

This system treats you as a **learner**, not a code generator:
- **Guides** you through understanding concepts
- **Asks questions** to develop your thinking
- **Shows patterns** instead of complete solutions
- **Verifies understanding** before advancing
- **Coordinates specialists** for comprehensive learning

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start learning something new
/start-learning autonomous navigation

# Resume your learning journey
/continue-plan

# Get help from a specialist
/ask-specialist How do ROS2 transforms work?

# Check your understanding
/check-understanding Strategy pattern

# Update your progress
/update-plan
```

## 📚 What's Included

## 🌟 Key Features

### Learning Plans
- **Progressive phases**: Research → Design → Implement → Reflect
- **Understanding checkpoints**: Verify learning before advancing
- **Learning journal**: Document insights and challenges
- **Specialist mapping**: Know which experts help with what

### Teaching Approach
- ❌ **Won't** give you complete code solutions
- ✅ **Will** guide you through understanding
- ✅ **Will** teach concepts and patterns
- ✅ **Will** help you design your own solutions
- ✅ **Will** verify understanding at each step

### 12 Specialist Agents
Each specialized in teaching their domain:
- **ros2-learning-mentor** - ROS2 concepts
- **code-architecture-mentor** - 10 design patterns with situational guidance
- **robotics-vision-navigator** - Computer vision, SLAM, navigation
- **jetank-hardware-specialist** - Hardware integration with safety-first
- And 8 more specialists...

## 🎓 Example Learning Journey

```bash
# Day 1: Start ambitious project
/start-learning autonomous navigation
# → Creates 6-8 week learning plan
# → Phase 1: Understanding path planning algorithms

# Day 3: Get stuck on concept
/ask-specialist When to use A* vs RRT?
# → robotics-vision-navigator explains comparison
# → Teaches decision factors

# Day 7: Check progress
/update-plan
# → Document insights
# → Reflect on learning

# Day 10: Verify understanding
/check-understanding Phase 1
# → Discussion-based assessment
# → Cleared to proceed!

# Day 11: Continue journey
/continue-plan
# → Phase 2: System design begins
```

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Start with `/start-learning`** for new topics
2. **Use `/check-understanding`** at phase boundaries
3. **Update regularly** with `/update-plan`
4. **Ask questions** anytime with `/ask-specialist`
5. **Be patient** - deep understanding takes time
6. **Reflect** - use learning journal sections
7. **Practice** - implement what you learn

## 🎯 Best For

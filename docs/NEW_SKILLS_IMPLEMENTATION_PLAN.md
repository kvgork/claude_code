- Fallback: Git branch for easy revert

**Risk 3: False positives in security scanning**
- Mitigation: Use trusted scanning tools (npm audit, Snyk)
- Fallback: Manual security review

**Risk 4: Multi-language complexity**
- Mitigation: Incremental language support
- Fallback: Focus on Python/JavaScript initially

### Adoption Risks

**Risk 1: Developer trust**
- Mitigation: Start with opt-in, demonstrate value
- Fallback: Make all skills optional

**Risk 2: Learning curve**
- Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation, examples
- Fallback: Gradual rollout with training

## How to Use the Skills

### For Agents

Agents use the `Skill` tool with natural language queries:

```markdown
# Learning plan operations
Skill(learning-plan-manager) with query:
"Find the latest learning plan and get current status"

# Code analysis
Skill(code-analysis) with query:
"Analyze src/ and find integration points for navigation feature"
```

Skills return **structured JSON** that agents interpret and use to formulate teaching responses.

### For Developers

Skills can be imported and used directly in Python:

```python
from skills.learning_plan_manager import LearningPlanManager
from skills.code_analysis import CodeAnalyzer

# Learning plan operations
manager = LearningPlanManager()
plan = manager.find_latest_plan()
progress = plan.calculate_progress()

# Code analysis
analyzer = CodeAnalyzer()
analysis = analyzer.analyze_codebase("src/")
patterns = analysis.architectural_patterns
```

## Known Limitations

### learning-plan-manager
- Currently handles only markdown format (not YAML or JSON plans)
- Parser expects specific markdown structure (but is flexible)
- Validation warnings for incomplete plans (by design)
- No multi-plan merge/compare functionality yet

### code-analysis
- Full support for Python only (C++ support is basic)
- Pattern detection accuracy: ~80% (room for improvement)
- No runtime analysis (static only)
- Dependency graph doesn't include dynamic imports

### General
- Skills are stateless (no persistent cache)
- No cross-session state management yet
- Performance not optimized for very large codebases (1000+ files)

## Key Insights & Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Pydantic models** made data handling clean and type-safe
2. **Iterative testing** caught issues early
3. **Clear separation** between skills (data) and agents (teaching)
4. **Real data testing** revealed edge cases
5. **Comprehensive specs** made implementation straightforward
6. **Test-driven approach** ensured quality

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Earlier testing** - could have tested after each component
2. **More pattern examples** - for better pattern detection training
3. **Incremental commits** - should have committed after each major component
4. **Performance profiling** - would help optimize hot paths

### Architecture Decisions That Worked

1. **Skills as data providers** - Agents interpret and teach (clear separation)
2. **Structured JSON output** - Easy for agents to consume
3. **Graceful degradation** - Malformed input doesn't crash, just warns
4. **Stateless design** - Each invocation is independent (simpler)
5. **Test coverage** - Comprehensive tests ensure reliability

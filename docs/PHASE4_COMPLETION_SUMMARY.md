## Integration with Other Skills

### With learning-plan-manager
```python
# Track plan completion in history
plan_hist = PlanHistory(
    plan_id=plan.metadata.plan_id,
    plan_title=plan.title,
    # ... metrics ...
)
state_mgr.add_plan_to_history(student_id, plan_hist)
```

### With learning-analytics
```python
# Use analytics for achievement checking
analytics = analyzer.analyze_plan(plan)
new_achievements = state_mgr.check_achievements(student_id, analytics)
```

### With interactive-diagram
```python
# Could visualize learning history:
# - Timeline of completed plans
# - Achievement progress chart
# - Velocity trend graph
```

---

## Example Usage

### Basic Workflow
```python
from skills.session_state import StateManager

manager = StateManager()

# Create student (first time)
state = manager.create_student(
    "alex_2025",
    name="Alex",
    learning_style="visual"
)

# Start session
session = manager.start_session("alex_2025", plan_id="nav_1")

# During session
state.current_session.tasks_completed.append("task-1-1")
manager.save_state(state)

# End session
manager.end_session("alex_2025", "Great progress!")

# Check achievements
new_achievements = manager.check_achievements("alex_2025")
```

### Personalized Teaching
```python
# Get teaching insights
insights = manager.get_teaching_insights("alex_2025")

if "visual diagrams" in insights.effective_strategies:
    # Include diagrams in response
    pass

if insights.struggles_with:
    # Provide extra support on these topics
    pass
```

### Returning Student Welcome
```python
state = manager.get_student("alex_2025")
activity = manager.get_recent_activity("alex_2025", days=7)

print(f"Welcome back, {state.profile.name}!")
print(f"Last session: {activity['last_session']}")
print(f"Tasks completed this week: {activity['tasks_completed_this_period']}")
```

## Performance Characteristics

### File I/O
- Load state: ~10-50ms per student
- Save state: ~10-50ms per student
- Acceptable for learning context (not real-time)

### Memory
- StudentState: ~50-200KB per student
- Can cache 100+ students in memory
- Lazy loading minimizes memory usage

### Scalability
- **< 100 students**: File-based perfect ✅
- **100-1000 students**: Still fine, works well ✅
- **1000+ students**: Consider database migration

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. File-Based vs Database
**Chosen**: File-based JSON storage

**Reasons**:
- Simple, no database setup
- Human-readable for debugging
- Version control friendly
- Easy backup and portability
- Sufficient for target scale

### 2. One File Per Student
**Chosen**: Individual JSON files

**Reasons**:
- Easy to find specific student
- No file locking issues
- Parallel access possible
- Easy to archive/delete students

### 3. Achievement Checking
**Chosen**: Manual trigger (agents call `check_achievements()`)

**Reasons**:
- Agents control when to celebrate
- Can batch check at session end
- More flexible timing

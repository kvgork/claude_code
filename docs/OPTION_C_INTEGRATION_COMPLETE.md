## Integration Impact Analysis

### Before Integration

**Agents had to**:
- Manually parse markdown with regex

- Guess at integration points
- Use only Grep/Glob for code search
- Calculate progress manually
- Make generic recommendations

**Limitations**:
- Error-prone parsing
- No structured data
- Limited code understanding
- Generic advice without context
- No progress analytics
- Time-consuming operations

### After Integration

**Agents can now**:
- Query structured plan data instantly
- Get exact progress percentages
- Find integration points automatically
- Detect design patterns in code
- Calculate complexity metrics
- Build dependency graphs
- Provide context-aware guidance

**Capabilities Unlocked**:
- ✅ Context-aware learning plans with specific files and line numbers
- ✅ Progress analytics and insights
- ✅ Code quality feedback based on actual metrics
- ✅ Architectural understanding through pattern detection
- ✅ Pattern-based teaching (follow existing patterns)
- ✅ Integration point suggestions with reasoning
- ✅ Complexity-aware task planning

- Had to manually parse markdown
- Calculated progress with regex
- No structured access to plan data

**After**:
- Loads plans with single skill call
- Gets exact progress percentages
- Can search tasks, update status
- Generates progress reports automatically

**Example Use**:
```markdown
Skill(learning-plan-manager) with query:
"Find latest plan and get current status"

Returns: Structured JSON with current phase, next task, progress
```

### file-search-agent
**Skill**: code-analysis

**Before**:
- Used only Glob/Grep
- No pattern detection
- No complexity awareness

**After**:
- Deep code intelligence via AST
- Pattern detection (Factory, Strategy, etc.)
- Complexity metrics per file
- Integration point identification
- Dependency graph generation

**Example Use**:
```markdown
Skill(code-analysis) with query:
"Analyze src/ and identify components related to data export"

Returns: Files with complexity, patterns, integration points
```

### plan-generation-mentor
**Skills**: code-analysis (direct) + learning-plan-manager (via coordinator)

**Before**:
- Generic learning plans
- No codebase awareness
- Generic "read the code" tasks

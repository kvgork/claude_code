## Overview

### What Are Skills?

Skills are capability extensions that agents can invoke within their workflow using the `Skill` tool. Unlike agents (which spawn separate AI instances), skills run as Python code and return structured data.

### Phase 1 Skills

#### learning-plan-manager
- **Purpose**: Structured operations on learning plan markdown files
- **Used by**: learning-coordinator, plan-generation-mentor
- **Returns**: JSON with plan data, progress stats, task information
- **Key operations**: Load plans, track progress, update tasks, generate reports

#### code-analysis
- **Purpose**: Deep Python static code analysis with AST parsing
- **Used by**: file-search-agent, plan-generation-mentor, code-architecture-mentor
- **Returns**: JSON with code structure, patterns, complexity, integration points
- **Key operations**: Analyze files/codebases, detect patterns, suggest integration points

---

## Skill Invocation Basics

### How Agents Invoke Skills

Agents use the `Skill` tool with a natural language query:

```markdown
Skill(skill-name) with query:
"Natural language description of what you want the skill to do"
```

### Example Invocations

```markdown
# Learning plan manager
Skill(learning-plan-manager) with query:
"Find the latest learning plan and get current phase"

# Code analysis
Skill(code-analysis) with query:
"Analyze src/ directory and identify integration points for navigation feature"
```

### What Skills Return

Skills return **structured JSON** that agents can parse and interpret. The JSON format varies by skill but is always well-documented in the skill's documentation.

---

## learning-plan-manager Examples

### Example 1: Learning Coordinator Loading Plan

**Scenario**: Student runs `/continue-plan` and learning-coordinator needs to load their progress.

**Agent**: learning-coordinator

**Invocation**:
```markdown
Skill(learning-plan-manager) with query:
"Find the latest learning plan in plans/ directory and return current status"
```

**Skill Returns**:
```json
{
  "plan_found": true,

      "title": "Run integration tests",
      "status": "NOT_STARTED",
      "description": "Test full system integration..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**How Agent Uses This**:
```markdown
I found 4 testing-related tasks in your plan:

‚úÖ **Phase 2** - Test basic navigation (COMPLETED)

‚è≥ **Phase 3** - Testing tasks you'll work on soon:
   - Write unit tests for path planner
   - Test edge cases and failure modes

‚è≥ **Phase 4** - Future testing:
   - Run integration tests

Since you've completed basic testing in Phase 2, let's focus on finishing
the remaining Phase 2 tasks first. Then we can dive deeper into comprehensive
testing in Phase 3.

Would you like to continue with the current Phase 2 tasks, or do you have
specific testing questions?
```

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Core Implementation Files

### 1. `src/client.py` (345 lines)
- **Purpose**: Main client interface for data operations
- **Key Components**:
  - `Client` class (Lines 45-230, Complexity: 8)
  - `export_data()` function (Lines 156-189, Complexity: 6)
- **Design Pattern**: N/A (client code)
- **Integration Points**:
  - `export_data()` at line 156: Add CSV format option here
  - Currently handles JSON and XML formats
  - Complexity is moderate (6) - be careful when extending

### 2. `src/exporters/base.py` (156 lines)
- **Purpose**: Abstract base class for all exporters
- **Key Components**:
  - `DataExporter` class (Lines 12-85, Complexity: 3)
  - `register_exporter()` function (Line 94)
- **Design Pattern**: Factory (detected by code-analysis)
- **Integration Points**:
  - Create `CSVExporter` subclass extending `DataExporter`
  - Register CSV exporter at line 94 using `register_exporter()`
  - Low complexity (3) - good starting point for learning

### 3. `src/formatters/json_formatter.py` (124 lines)
- **Purpose**: JSON formatting strategy
- **Design Pattern**: Strategy (detected by code-analysis)
- **Relevance**: Template for creating `csv_formatter.py`
- **Note**: Follow same interface for consistency

---

## üîó File Relationships

### Dependency Map (from code-analysis)
```
src/client.py (Complexity: 8)
  ‚îî‚îÄ imports: DataExporter from src/exporters/base.py

src/exporters/json_exporter.py (Complexity: 4)
  ‚îú‚îÄ imports: DataExporter from src/exporters/base.py
  ‚îî‚îÄ imports: JSONFormatter from src/formatters/json_formatter.py
```

### Integration Points
1. **Extension Point**: `src/client.py:156` - `export_data()` function
   - Reason: Main export entry point, add CSV option here
   - Complexity: Medium (6) - requires careful modification

2. **Base Class**: `src/exporters/base.py:12` - `DataExporter` class
   - Reason: Factory pattern base, create CSVExporter subclass
   - Complexity: Low (3) - easy to extend

3. **Registration**: `src/exporters/base.py:94` - `register_exporter()` function
   - Reason: Factory registration point
   - Complexity: Low - straightforward addition

---

## üí° Planning Recommendations

### Files to Modify
1. **`src/client.py:156`** (Complexity: 6, Function)
   - Why: Add CSV option to export_data() function
   - What: Add "csv" case to format selection logic
   - Integration point: Line 156 in export_data()
   - Caution: Keep complexity low - function already at 6

2. **`src/exporters/base.py:94`** (Complexity: 3)
   - Why: Register CSV exporter in factory
   - What: Call register_exporter("csv", CSVExporter)

### New Files to Create
1. **`src/formatters/csv_formatter.py`**
   - Purpose: CSV formatting logic
   - Why here: Matches existing formatter structure
   - Pattern to use: Strategy (matches json_formatter.py)
   - Should integrate with: CSVExporter class

2. **`src/exporters/csv_exporter.py`**
   - Purpose: CSV exporter implementation
   - Pattern to use: Factory (extend DataExporter)
   - Should integrate with: csv_formatter.py

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Design Patterns**: Factory pattern detected in base.py
  - Your CSVExporter should extend DataExporter
  - Register with factory using register_exporter()
- **Code Structure**: Average complexity is 3-6, keep CSV exporter similar
- **Testing approach**: Check existing test files for patterns

---

## üéØ Next Steps for Planning Agent

The planning agent should:
1. Review `src/exporters/base.py:12-85` to understand Factory pattern
2. Study `src/formatters/json_formatter.py` as template for CSV formatter
3. Follow Factory pattern for consistency
4. Target complexity < 5 for CSV components
5. Plan integration at line 156 in client.py

**Priority Order** (based on code-analysis):
1. `src/exporters/base.py` - Low complexity, good starting point
2. `src/formatters/json_formatter.py` - Template to follow
3. `src/client.py:156` - Integration point (moderate complexity)
```

**How Agent Uses This** (in generated learning plan):
```markdown
## Phase 1: Understanding Agent Architecture

### Task 1.1: Study Existing Agent Pattern
**Learning Activity**: Analyze the agent system architecture

**Files to Read**:
1. `src/agents/base.py:15-120` - BaseAgent abstract class
   - **Complexity**: Low (4) - Good starting point
   - **Pattern**: This is your template!
   - **Questions**: What methods must you implement? What's provided?

2. `src/agents/registry.py:23-90` - AgentRegistry singleton
   - **Pattern**: Singleton pattern (maintains single registry instance)
   - **Questions**: How do agents register? When does registration happen?

**Understanding Goals**:
- Why use Singleton for registry?
- What's the Factory pattern role?
- How do agents integrate with the system?

**Specialist Support**: code-architecture-mentor can explain Singleton pattern

### Task 1.2: Design Your Learning Agent
**Design Decision**: How will your agent extend BaseAgent?

**Context from Code Analysis**:
- **Must extend**: `BaseAgent` at src/agents/base.py:15
- **Must implement**: process(), validate(), execute() methods
- **Must register**: Using register_agent() at src/agents/registry.py:67
- **Complexity target**: Keep it ~4 like other agents

**Design Questions**:
- What makes a "learning agent" unique?
- What additional methods might you need?
- How will it interact with other agents?

**Checkpoint**: Have design that follows existing pattern?
```

    ]
  }
}
```

**How Agent Uses This** (teaching response):
```markdown
Let me help you understand the architecture of this codebase!

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Overview

### Design Patterns in Use

The codebase uses 4 main design patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern** (2 instances)
   - `src/agents/registry.py` - Ensures single agent registry
   - `src/config/settings.py` - Global configuration
   - **Why**: These should only exist once in the application

2. **Factory Pattern** (2 instances)
   - `src/agents/factory.py` - Creates agents dynamically
   - `src/exporters/base.py` - Creates exporters by type
   - **Why**: Decouples creation from usage, easy to extend

3. **Strategy Pattern** (2 instances)
   - `src/formatters/json_formatter.py` - JSON formatting strategy
   - `src/formatters/xml_formatter.py` - XML formatting strategy
   - **Why**: Interchangeable algorithms, easy to add new formats

4. **Observer Pattern** (1 instance)
   - `src/events/publisher.py` - Event notification system
   - **Why**: Loose coupling between components

### Complexity Analysis

The codebase is generally well-structured:
- üìó **28 simple files** (complexity < 5) - Easy to modify
- üìô **10 moderate files** (complexity 5-10) - Requires care
- üìï **4 complex files** (complexity > 10) - Needs attention

**Recommendation**: When adding new features, target complexity < 5
to match the majority of the codebase.

### System Entry Points

The application has 3 main entry points:
1. `src/main.py:main()` - Main application entry
2. `src/api/server.py:start_server()` - API server mode
3. `src/cli/app.py:run_cli()` - Command-line interface

### Dependency Health

‚úÖ **Good news**: No circular dependencies detected!

**Core dependencies** (most files depend on these):
- `src/agents/base.py` - Agent base class (foundation)
- `src/config/settings.py` - Configuration (used everywhere)
- `src/utils/logging.py` - Logging utilities (cross-cutting)

### Architectural Recommendations

When adding new features:
1. **Follow existing patterns** - Use Factory for new object types
2. **Keep complexity low** - Match the existing average (~5)
3. **Avoid circular deps** - Keep the clean dependency graph
4. **Extend base classes** - Don't reinvent what exists

Do you have questions about any of these patterns?
```

#### Step 4: Plan Generation Creates Context-Aware Plan

Uses the context to create learning plan with:
- Specific files to study
- Actual integration points with line numbers
- Patterns to follow from existing code
- Complexity targets based on codebase

#### Step 5: Learning Coordinator Executes Plan

```markdown
Skill(learning-plan-manager) with query:
"Load plan from plans/2025-10-19-navigation-system-learning-plan.md"
```

Tracks progress as student works through phases.

**Result**: Student gets context-aware, structured learning journey with:
- ‚úÖ Relevant codebase files identified
- ‚úÖ Integration points specified
- ‚úÖ Patterns to follow documented
- ‚úÖ Progress tracked automatically
- ‚úÖ Teaching specialists coordinated

## Error Handling

### Handling Skill Errors

Skills may return errors. Agents should handle gracefully:

```markdown
Skill(code-analysis) with query:
"Analyze non-existent-directory/"
```

**Possible Error Response**:
```json
{
  "error": true,
  "error_type": "DirectoryNotFound",
  "message": "Directory 'non-existent-directory/' does not exist",
  "suggestion": "Check the directory path and try again"
}
```

**Agent Response**:
```markdown
I tried to analyze the directory but couldn't find it.

Could you verify the directory path? Here are the common source directories
I can see:
- src/
- lib/
- modules/

Which directory would you like me to analyze?
```

### No Data Found

```markdown
Skill(learning-plan-manager) with query:
"Find latest learning plan"
```

**Response when no plans exist**:
```json
{
  "plan_found": false,
  "plans_directory": "plans/",
  "message": "No learning plans found in plans/ directory"
}
```

**Agent Response**:
```markdown
I don't see any existing learning plans. Would you like me to create a new one?

What feature or topic would you like to learn about?
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Skills Appropriately

‚úÖ **DO**: Use skills for data gathering and analysis
```markdown
Skill(code-analysis) with query: "Analyze src/ for patterns"
# Agent interprets results and teaches
```

‚ùå **DON'T**: Expect skills to teach or make decisions
```markdown
# Skills don't teach - agents do!
```

### 2. Parse and Interpret Results

‚úÖ **DO**: Extract relevant information and present it educationally
```markdown
# Agent extracts from skill JSON:
"I found a Factory pattern at line 23. Let's discuss why this pattern
is useful and how you might extend it..."
```

‚ùå **DON'T**: Dump raw JSON to students
```markdown
# Don't show students raw skill output
```

### 3. Handle Missing Data

‚úÖ **DO**: Provide alternatives when skills can't help
```markdown
"The code-analysis skill works best with Python code. Since this is C++,
let's use traditional codebase exploration techniques instead..."
```

### 4. Combine Skills When Appropriate

‚úÖ **DO**: Use both skills for comprehensive workflows
```markdown
# 1. Use code-analysis to understand codebase
# 2. Create context-aware learning plan
# 3. Use learning-plan-manager to track progress
```

### 5. Maintain Teaching Philosophy

‚úÖ **DO**: Use skill data to guide, not solve
```markdown
"The analysis shows a Factory pattern at line 45.
Before we look at it, what do you know about the Factory pattern?
Let's explore how it's used here and why..."
```

‚ùå **DON'T**: Use skills to provide complete solutions
```markdown
# Don't use skill output to solve problems for students
```

```

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (15 minutes)

**Implement**:
- Skill.md for agent integration

- Student behind schedule
- Student with struggles
- Student with steady progress
- Student with burst progress

### Integration Tests

Test with real learning plans from `plans/` directory.

---

## Integration with Agents

### learning-coordinator

**Use case**: Monitor student progress and adjust teaching.

```markdown
Skill(learning-analytics) with query:
"Analyze current learning plan and identify any struggles or areas needing attention"

Returns:
{
  "struggle_areas": [
    {
      "task_title": "Implement A* algorithm",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "duration_days": 10,
      "recommendation": "Consult robotics-vision-navigator for algorithm guidance"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "priority": "high",
      "title": "Schedule specialist consultation",
      "description": "Student has been on A* task for 10 days. Suggest consulting specialist."
    }
  ]
}

Agent interprets and acts:
"I notice you've been working on the A* algorithm for 10 days. This is a complex topic!
Would you like to consult with robotics-vision-navigator to help you work through it?"
```

### plan-generation-mentor

**Use case**: Use historical data to improve time estimates.

```markdown
Skill(learning-analytics) with query:
"Analyze time estimation accuracy across all completed plans"

Returns:
{
  "estimation_accuracy": "optimistic",
  "variance_percentage": -25,
  "recommendations": [
    "Add 25% buffer to implementation phase estimates",
    "Research tasks typically take 2x estimated time"
  ]
}

Agent uses for future plans:
"Based on previous plans, I'm estimating 3 weeks for this phase (with a typical variance buffer)."
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Time Complexity

- **Velocity calculation**: O(n) where n = number of tasks
- **Struggle detection**: O(n) where n = number of tasks
- **Pattern detection**: O(n log n) for sorting
- **Comprehensive analysis**: O(n) overall

### Memory Usage

- Loads one plan at a time
- Analytics result ~10-50KB JSON
- No caching needed (fast enough to recalculate)

### Optimization

- Calculate metrics lazily (only when requested)
- Cache analytics result if analyzing same plan multiple times
- Process tasks in single pass when possible

## Next Steps After Implementation

### 1. Agent Integration

Update agents to use learning-analytics:
- learning-coordinator: Monitor and respond to struggles
- plan-generation-mentor: Use time estimation data

### 2. Dashboard/Visualization

Consider creating visual dashboards for:
- Velocity trends over time
- Checkpoint performance
- Struggle areas timeline

### 3. Advanced Features (Future)

- Multi-student comparison
- Cohort analytics
- Predictive modeling
- Personalized learning path optimization

## Summary

The learning-analytics skill provides:

âœ… **Data-driven insights** into learning progress
âœ… **Early struggle detection** for proactive support
âœ… **Pattern recognition** to reinforce success
âœ… **Actionable recommendations** for teaching optimization
âœ… **Time estimation improvement** based on actual data

**Dependencies**: Only learning-plan-manager (Phase 1) âœ…

**Complexity**: Medium - straightforward algorithms, clear data models

**Value**: High - transforms learning coordination from reactive to proactive

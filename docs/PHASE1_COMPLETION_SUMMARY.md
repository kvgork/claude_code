## Integration Examples

### Example 1: Context-Aware Planning

**Before** (without skills):
```python
# Agent manually searches with Grep
files = glob("src/**/*.py")
# Agent manually reads and guesses integration points
```

**After** (with code-analysis):
```python
analyzer = CodeAnalyzer()
analysis = analyzer.analyze_codebase("src/")

# Automatic integration point identification
suggestions = analysis.suggest_integration_for_feature("new agent type")
# â†’ Returns specific classes/functions with reasoning
```

### Example 2: Intelligent Progress Tracking

**Before** (without skills):
```python
# Agent manually parses markdown
content = read_file("plan.md")
# Regex to find current phase
# Manual parsing to find next task
```

**After** (with learning-plan-manager):
```python
manager = LearningPlanManager()
plan = manager.find_latest_plan()

# Structured queries
current = plan.get_current_phase()
next_task = plan.get_next_task()
progress = plan.calculate_progress()  # 23.5%
```

### Example 3: Combined Intelligence

```python
# Learning progress
plan = LearningPlanManager().find_latest_plan()
progress = plan.calculate_progress()

# Code quality
code_analysis = CodeAnalyzer().analyze_codebase("src/")
smells = sum(len(f.smells) for f in code_analysis.files)

# Integrated feedback
if progress["overall_percentage"] > 50 and smells > 0:
    agent_says("Good progress! But let's review code quality...")
```

- No structured data
- Limited code understanding
- Generic advice without context
- No progress analytics

### After Phase 1 Skills

**Agents can now**:
- Query structured plan data instantly
- Get exact progress percentages
- Find integration points automatically
- Detect design patterns in code
- Calculate complexity metrics
- Build dependency graphs
- Provide context-aware guidance

**Capabilities Unlocked**:
- âœ… Context-aware learning plans
- âœ… Progress analytics and insights
- âœ… Code quality feedback
- âœ… Architectural understanding
- âœ… Pattern-based teaching
- âœ… Integration point suggestions

3. **Clear separation** between skills and agents
4. **Real data testing** revealed edge cases
5. **Comprehensive specs** made implementation straightforward

### What We'd Do Differently
1. **Earlier testing** - could have tested after each file
2. **More pattern examples** - for better pattern detection
3. **Incremental commits** - should have committed after each major component

### Key Insights
1. **Skills as data providers** - Let agents interpret and teach
2. **Structured output critical** - JSON is agent-friendly
3. **Graceful degradation** - Malformed input shouldn't crash
4. **Documentation = adoption** - Good docs ensure skill usage
5. **Test integration early** - Shows real-world value

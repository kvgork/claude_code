## Operations Interface Pattern

### Template for Adding Operations to Skills

Based on the successful test-orchestrator implementation, here's the pattern to follow:

#### 1. Create `operations.py` in skill directory

```python
"""
[Skill Name] Operations

Standardized operations interface for agent invocation.
"""

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
import time

# Import skill's core modules
from .core.module_name import CoreClass


@dataclass
class OperationResult:
    """Result from a skill operation."""
    success: bool
    data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    error: Optional[str] = None
    error_code: Optional[str] = None
    duration: float = 0.0
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None


def operation_name(param1: str, **kwargs) -> OperationResult:
    """
    Operation description.

    Args:
        param1: Parameter description
        **kwargs: Additional parameters

    Returns:
        OperationResult with operation data
    """
    start_time = time.time()

    try:
        # Use core modules to perform operation
        core = CoreClass()
        result = core.do_something(param1)

        duration = time.time() - start_time

        return OperationResult(
            success=True,
            data={
                "key": "value",
                # ... structured result data
            },
            duration=duration,
            metadata={
                "skill": "skill-name",
                "operation": "operation_name",
                "version": "0.1.0"
            }
        )

    except FileNotFoundError:
        return OperationResult(
            success=False,
            error=f"File not found: {param1}",
            error_code="FILE_NOT_FOUND",
            duration=time.time() - start_time
        )
    except Exception as e:
        return OperationResult(
            success=False,
            error=f"Operation failed: {str(e)}",
            error_code="OPERATION_ERROR",
            duration=time.time() - start_time
        )


# Export all operations
__all__ = ["operation_name", "OperationResult"]
```

#### 2. Update `__init__.py` to export operations

```python
from .core.module import CoreClass
from .operations import operation_name, OperationResult

__all__ = [
    # Core components
    "CoreClass",
    # Operations
    "operation_name",
    "OperationResult"
]
```

#### 3. Update `skill.md` frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Skill description
version: 0.1.0
tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
activation: manual
operations:
  operation_name: "Operation description"
  another_operation: "Another operation description"
---
```

---

## Next Steps

   - refactor-assistant (3 operations needed)
   - pr-review-assistant (4 operations needed)
   - dependency-guardian (3 operations needed)
   - spec-to-implementation (2 operations needed)

2. **Create integration tests** (Priority: MEDIUM)

   - Performance tests

3. **Update documentation** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Agent integration guide
   - Skill development guide
   - API reference

### Short-term (Next Session)

4. **Phase 2 Skills** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - doc-generator operations
   - code-search operations
   - git-workflow-assistant operations

5. **Enhanced Features** (Priority: LOW)

   - Skill caching
   - Performance optimization

6. **Commit to Git** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Commit all new skills
   - Commit integration layer
   - Create PR with summary

## Implementation Notes

### What's Working

✅ Skill discovery automatically finds all skills with `skill.md` files
✅ YAML frontmatter parsing extracts metadata and operations
✅ Dynamic module loading with dependency resolution
✅ Operation invocation with standardized request/response
✅ Comprehensive error handling with error codes
✅ Metrics collection for monitoring
✅ Test-orchestrator fully functional via operations interface

### Important Considerations

⚠️ **Attribute Mapping**
- Core modules use specific attribute names (e.g., `params` not `parameters`)
- Operations must map these correctly to avoid errors
- Use `getattr()` for optional attributes

⚠️ **Data Structure Conversion**
- Sets must be converted to lists for JSON serialization
- Dataclass objects must be converted to dicts
- Use list comprehensions for collections

⚠️ **Error Handling**
- Always wrap operations in try/except
- Return proper error codes (FILE_NOT_FOUND, VALIDATION_ERROR, etc.)
- Include duration even on errors
- Provide helpful error messages

## Testing Checklist

For each skill after adding operations interface:

- [ ] Operations defined in skill.md frontmatter
- [ ] operations.py created with all operations
- [ ] __init__.py exports operations
- [ ] All operations return OperationResult
- [ ] Error handling for common errors
- [ ] Test with direct import: `from skills.skill_name.operations import operation`
- [ ] Test with integration layer: `invoker.invoke('skill-name', 'operation', params)`
- [ ] Verify in integration demo
- [ ] Check metrics collection

---

## Reference: test-orchestrator Operations

**File:** `skills/test_orchestrator/operations.py`

**Operations:**
1. `analyze_file(source_file: str)` - Analyzes Python source
2. `generate_tests(source_file: str, target_coverage: float)` - Generates test suite
3. `analyze_coverage(test_results_file: Optional[str])` - Analyzes coverage

**Key Lessons:**
- Use actual dataclass attribute names (e.g., `analysis.total_functions` not `len(analysis.functions)`)
- Convert sets to lists for JSON serialization
- Handle nested dataclasses properly (e.g., convert methods list)
- Always include metadata with skill name, operation, version
- Duration tracking is important for metrics

---

## Commands to Continue

### Test current integration:
```bash
python -m skills.integration.examples.agent_skill_demo
```

### Test specific skill operations:
```bash
python -c "
from skills.integration import SkillInvoker, SkillLoader, SkillRegistry

registry = SkillRegistry('skills')
registry.discover_skills()
loader = SkillLoader(registry)
invoker = SkillInvoker(loader)

result = invoker.invoke(
    'test-orchestrator',
    'generate_tests',
    {'source_file': 'path/to/file.py'}
)
print(f'Success: {result.success}')
print(f'Tests: {result.data.get(\"tests_generated\") if result.data else 0}')
"
```

### Run individual skill demo:
```bash
python -m skills.test_orchestrator.demo
python -m skills.refactor_assistant.demo
python -m skills.pr_review_assistant.demo
```

## 🔄 How Agents Work Together

### Common Workflows

**1. Learning Journey**
```
User → learning-coordinator → specialist agents → learning-coordinator (summary)
```

**2. Context-Aware Project Planning**
```
/create-project-plan → project-plan-orchestrator → file-search-agent → plan-generation-mentor
```

**3. Specialized Consultation**
```
/ask-specialist → learning-coordinator routes to → appropriate specialist
```

**4. Guided Implementation**
```
User → plan-generation-mentor (creates plan) → User implements with specialist guidance
```

## 🎓 Teaching Philosophy

All agents follow these principles:
- ❌ **NEVER** provide complete solutions
- ✅ **ALWAYS** teach concepts first
- ✅ **ALWAYS** ask guiding questions (Socratic method)
- ✅ **ALWAYS** provide structure, not implementation
- ✅ **ALWAYS** verify understanding with checkpoints

## 📋 Context: Current State

### What Exists (from codebase analysis)
- **14 agents** in `agents/` directory
- **8 commands** in `commands/` directory
- **3 agent categories**: Coordinators, Mentors, Specialists
- **Newly added**: Context-aware planning system (file-search-agent, project-plan-orchestrator)

### Key Issues Identified
1. **Tool configuration inconsistency**: Some use lists, some use comma-separated
2. **Missing activation patterns**: Only 1 agent specifies activation behavior
3. **No validation**: Agents could have errors that go undetected
4. **Command registration**: New command not registered
5. **Large files**: learning-coordinator.md is 472 lines
6. **No agent registry**: Hard to discover available agents

### Improvement Goals
- Standardize all agent configurations
- Create infrastructure for validation and discovery
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Test new features
- Improve maintainability

## 📚 Phase 1: Understanding Current Architecture (Week 1)

### Learning Goals
- Deeply understand the existing agent system
- Map relationships between agents
- Identify patterns and inconsistencies
- Build mental model of how everything works together

### Research & Analysis Tasks

#### Task 1.1: Agent System Deep Dive
**Learning Activity**: Study the agent architecture

**Files to Read & Analyze**:
1. `agents/learning-coordinator.md` - Master coordinator (472 lines)
   - How does it coordinate other agents?
   - What's the reflection-first approach?
   - Why is it so large?

2. `agents/project-plan-orchestrator.md` - Sequential workflow manager
   - How does it orchestrate file-search and planning?
   - What's the state tracking mechanism?
   - How does error handling work?

3. `agents/plan-generation-mentor.md` - Educational planner
   - How was it enhanced for context-awareness?
   - What's the Step 0 addition?
   - How does it read relevant-files markdown?

4. `agents/file-search-agent.md` - Codebase analyzer
   - What search strategies does it use?
   - How does it analyze and categorize files?
   - What's the output format?

**Understanding Questions**:
- How do coordinators differ from specialists?
- What's the flow from user request to specialist invocation?
- Why separate commands from agents?
- What makes an agent "proactive" vs "manual"?

**Exercise**: Draw a diagram showing:
- All 14 agents and their relationships
- Command → Agent invocation paths
- Data flow (where files are read/written)

**Checkpoint**: Can you explain to someone how a user request flows through the system?

#### Task 1.2: Configuration Pattern Analysis
**Learning Activity**: Analyze configuration inconsistencies

**Investigation**:
```bash
# In your terminal, examine tool configurations:
grep "tools:" agents/*.md | head -20

# Notice the differences:
# - Some: "tools: read, write, python"
# - Some: "tools:\n  - Read\n  - Write"
# - Capitalization varies
```

**Analysis Tasks**:
- Count how many agents use each format
- Document which agents have which format
- Identify if any cause parsing issues
- Research: What's the "correct" YAML format?

**Questions to Answer**:
- Why might this inconsistency exist?
- What problems could it cause?
- Which format should be the standard? Why?
- How would you migrate from one to another?

**Output**: Create `docs/tool-config-analysis.md` documenting findings

**Checkpoint**: Can you explain why standardization matters and what format to use?

#### Task 1.3: Documentation Exploration
**Learning Activity**: Understand existing documentation

**Files to Study**:
1. `docs/SUB_AGENTS_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive agent guide (2590 lines!)
2. `docs/PROJECT_PLANNING_SYSTEM.md` - New planning system docs
3. `docs/COMMANDS_README.md` - Commands documentation
4. `project-context/README.md` - Context directory explanation

**Questions to Explore**:
- What documentation exists and what's missing?
- How would a new user discover available agents?
- Is there overlap between docs that could be consolidated?
- What would make discovery easier?

**Exercise**: Try to answer these WITHOUT looking at code:
- "Which agent should I use for Python code review?"
- "How do I create a new specialist agent?"
- "What commands work with learning plans?"

**Gap Analysis**: What couldn't you answer easily?

**Checkpoint**: Have you identified the main documentation gaps?

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Understand all 14 agents and their purposes
- [ ] Can draw the system architecture from memory
- [ ] Identified all configuration inconsistencies
- [ ] Documented documentation gaps
- [ ] Ready to start standardization work

**Before Phase 2**: Review with learning-coordinator for understanding verification

## 🔧 Phase 2: Standardization & Quick Wins (Week 2)

### Learning Goals
- Apply consistent patterns across all agents
- Fix critical issues (tool configs, command registration)
- Create missing documentation
- Build confidence in making system-wide changes

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 2.1: Tool Configuration Standardization
**Design Decision**: Choose the standard format

**Research First**:
- Read YAML specification for lists
- Check Claude Code documentation for tool format
- Look at examples in other projects

**Standard Format Decision**:
```yaml
# Proposed standard (YAML list format):
tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Glob
  - Grep
```

**Why this format?**
- [Document your reasoning]
- Consider: Readability, parseability, extensibility

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Start with ONE agent as test case
2. Verify it still works after change
3. Create script or pattern for bulk update
4. Apply to all 14 agents
5. Test each one

**Files to Modify** (14 files):
- `agents/learning-coordinator.md` - Change `tools: read, write, bash, python` to list
- `agents/plan-generation-mentor.md` - Change `tools: read, write` to list
- `agents/project-plan-orchestrator.md` - Already uses list format (verify capitalization)
- ... (all other agents)

**Testing After Each Change**:
- Does the agent still appear in agent list?
- Can commands still invoke the agent?
- Are tools accessible?

**Checkpoint**: All agents use consistent tool configuration format

#### Task 2.2: Add Activation Patterns
**Learning Activity**: Understand activation behavior

**Research Questions**:
- What does `activation: proactive` mean?
- What does `activation: manual` mean?
- When should each be used?
- What happens if activation is not specified?

**Analysis**: For each agent, determine appropriate activation
- Coordinators: proactive (auto-invoked for their domain)
- Specialists: manual (invoked explicitly)
- Orchestrators: proactive (can be auto-invoked)

**Implementation**:
Add activation field to all agents based on analysis

**Example**:
```yaml
---
name: python-best-practices
description: Python coding standards specialist
tools:
  - Read
  - Write
activation: manual  # Added
model: sonnet
---
```

**Checkpoint**: All agents have activation pattern defined

#### Task 2.3: Register New Command
**Problem**: `/create-project-plan` returns "Unknown slash command"

**Investigation**:
- Read `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Understand how commands are registered
- Look for examples of command registration

**Solution**:
- Register the command properly
- Test that `/create-project-plan` works
- Document the registration process

**Checkpoint**: `/create-project-plan` command works

#### Task 2.4: Create AGENTS_REFERENCE.md
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all agents

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Agents Reference

Quick reference for all available agents.

## Coordinators
### learning-coordinator
- **Purpose**: Master learning orchestrator
- **When to use**: For guided learning experiences
- **Tools**: Read, Write, Bash, Python
- **Example**: "I want to learn ROS2 navigation"

[... all agents ...]

## Quick Selection Guide
- **Need to learn concept?** → ask-specialist or domain specialist
- **Need project plan?** → plan-generation-mentor or project-plan-orchestrator
- **Need code review?** → appropriate specialist (python, cpp, etc.)
[... etc ...]
```

**Content Source**: Use the analysis from `project-context/relevant-files-*.md`

**Checkpoint**: AGENTS_REFERENCE.md created and comprehensive

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] All agent tool configurations standardized
- [ ] All agents have activation patterns
- [ ] `/create-project-plan` command works
- [ ] AGENTS_REFERENCE.md created
- [ ] Learned how to make system-wide changes safely

**Before Phase 3**: Test all commands to ensure nothing broke

---

## 🏗️ Phase 3: Infrastructure Building (Week 3)

### Learning Goals
- Create validation and discovery infrastructure
- Build reusable templates and schemas
- Implement agent registry system
- Learn system design patterns

### Infrastructure Tasks

#### Task 3.1: Agent Schema Creation
**Learning Activity**: Design JSON schema for agent validation

**Research**:
- Study JSON Schema specification
- Look at schema examples in other projects
- Understand validation concepts

**Design Task**: Create `.agent-schema.json`

**Schema Should Define**:
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Claude Code Agent Schema",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["name", "description", "tools", "model"],
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$",
      "description": "Agent identifier in kebab-case"
    },
    "description": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 10,
      "maxLength": 200
    },
    "tools": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "enum": ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Glob", "Grep", "Bash", "Task"]
      }
    },
    "model": {
      "enum": ["sonnet", "opus", "haiku"]
    },
    "activation": {
      "enum": ["proactive", "manual", "always"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Questions**:
- What fields are required vs optional?
- What validation rules make sense?
- How to handle future extensibility?

**Checkpoint**: Schema created and validates existing agents

#### Task 3.2: Agent Registry System
**Design Challenge**: Create centralized agent discovery

**Options to Consider**:
1. **Static JSON file**: `agent-registry.json`
2. **Generated from markdown**: Parse agent files automatically
3. **Hybrid**: Markdown as source, JSON as compiled output

**Recommended Approach**: Hybrid
- Agents defined in markdown (source of truth)
- Script generates `agent-registry.json` from markdown
- Commands read registry for fast discovery

**Registry Structure**:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "last_updated": "2025-10-07",
  "agents": {
    "learning-coordinator": {
      "file": "agents/learning-coordinator.md",
      "type": "coordinator",
      "tools": ["Read", "Write", "Bash"],
      "activation": "proactive",
      "description": "Master learning orchestrator",
      "dependencies": ["all-teaching-agents"]
    },
    "python-best-practices": {
      "file": "agents/python-best-practices.md",
      "type": "specialist",
      "domain": "python",
      "tools": ["Read", "Write"],
      "activation": "manual"
    }
    // ... all agents
  },
  "commands": {
    "/create-project-plan": {
      "file": "commands/create-project-plan.md",
      "invokes": "project-plan-orchestrator",
      "description": "Create context-aware project plan"
    }
    // ... all commands
  }
}
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. Design registry structure
2. Create script to generate from markdown
3. Update commands to use registry
4. Add validation step

**Checkpoint**: Registry system working and used by commands

#### Task 3.3: Agent Templates
**Purpose**: Make creating new agents easier and consistent

**Templates to Create**:

1. **`templates/teaching-agent-template.md`**
```markdown
---
name: new-teaching-agent
description: [One-line description]
tools:
  - Read
  - Write
activation: manual
model: sonnet
---

You are the **new-teaching-agent**, an expert in [domain].

## TEACHING RULES (NEVER BREAK THESE)
- ❌ NEVER write complete [systems/implementations]
- ❌ NEVER provide copy-paste ready code
- ✅ ALWAYS explain concepts first
- ✅ ALWAYS guide through design thinking

[... rest of template ...]
```

2. **`templates/implementation-agent-template.md`**
3. **`templates/coordinator-agent-template.md`**

**Documentation**: Create `docs/CREATING_NEW_AGENTS.md` explaining how to use templates

**Checkpoint**: Templates created and documented

#### Task 3.4: Validation Script
**Purpose**: Catch errors before they cause problems

**Script**: `scripts/validate-agents.sh` or `.py`

**Validation Checks**:
1. All agent files have valid YAML frontmatter
2. Agent frontmatter matches schema
3. Required fields present
4. Tool names valid
5. No duplicate agent names
6. Files referenced in agents exist
7. Commands reference valid agents

**Integration**: Run validation in git pre-commit hook

**Checkpoint**: Validation script catches known issues

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Agent schema created and validates all agents
- [ ] Registry system implemented
- [ ] Agent templates created
- [ ] Validation script working
- [ ] Understand infrastructure design patterns

**Before Phase 4**: Run validation on entire codebase

---

## 🔬 Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Week 4)

### Learning Goals
- Validate new features work correctly
- Test context-aware planning system
- Refactor large agents for maintainability
- Measure improvement impact

### Testing & Refinement Tasks

#### Task 4.1: Test Context-Aware Planning
**Critical Test**: The entire reason for the new system!

**Test Scenario 1: Simple Feature**
```bash
/create-project-plan add logging to robot control
```

**Expected Behavior**:
1. file-search-agent searches for robot control files
2. Creates `project-context/relevant-files-*.md`
3. plan-generation-mentor reads analysis
4. Creates plan referencing actual files
5. User receives both paths

**Validation**:
- Do both files get created?
- Does plan reference actual files from analysis?
- Are integration points identified?

**Test Scenario 2: Complex Feature**
```bash
/create-project-plan autonomous navigation with SLAM
```

**Expected**: More files found, comprehensive plan

**Test Scenario 3: New Feature (no existing code)**
```bash
/create-project-plan blockchain integration
```

**Expected**: No files found, generic plan created

**Document Results**: What works? What doesn't?

**Checkpoint**: Context-aware planning system validated

#### Task 4.2: Agent Invocation Testing
**Purpose**: Ensure all agents can be invoked correctly

**Test Matrix**:
Create table of agent invocations to test:
```
| Agent | Direct Invocation | Via Command | Via Coordinator | Status |
|-------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| learning-coordinator | ✓ | /start-learning | N/A | [test] |
| python-best-practices | ✓ | /ask-specialist | ✓ | [test] |
[... all agents ...]
```

**Test Each Agent**:
- Can it be invoked?
- Does it have correct tool access?
- Does it follow its instructions?
- Does coordination work?

**Document Failures**: Any agents that don't work as expected?

**Checkpoint**: All agents pass invocation tests

#### Task 4.3: Refactor Large Agents
**Target**: learning-coordinator.md (472 lines)

**Analysis Question**: Why is it so large?
- Read through the file
- Identify distinct sections
- Determine what could be separate modules

**Refactoring Options**:
1. **Split into multiple files**:
   - `learning-coordinator-core.md` - Core logic
   - `learning-coordinator-examples.md` - Example interactions
   - Reference examples from core

2. **Extract to documentation**:
   - Move detailed examples to docs
   - Keep agents focused on behavior

3. **Create helper agents**:
   - Specialist-router agent
   - Progress-tracker agent

**Choose Approach**: What makes most sense for maintainability?

**Implementation**: Apply chosen refactoring

**Testing**: Ensure functionality unchanged after refactoring

**Checkpoint**: Large agents refactored, still functional

#### Task 4.4: Metrics & Impact Measurement
**Purpose**: Quantify the improvements

**Metrics to Collect**:
1. **Before/After Comparison**:
   - Number of inconsistencies: Before [X], After [0]
   - Agents with validation: Before [0], After [14]
   - Agent discovery time: Before [~5 min], After [~30 sec]

2. **Test Results**:
   - Agents passing validation: [X/14]
   - Commands working: [X/8]
   - Context-aware planning success rate: [%]

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Total lines of agent code
   - Average agent file size
   - Documentation coverage

**Report**: Create `docs/IMPROVEMENT_IMPACT.md` with metrics

**Checkpoint**: Impact measured and documented

### Phase 4 Success Criteria
- [ ] Context-aware planning system fully tested
- [ ] All agents pass validation
- [ ] Large agents refactored
- [ ] Improvements quantified
- [ ] System is more maintainable than before

**Final Review**: Present improvements to yourself/team

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Making Too Many Changes at Once
**Pitfall**: Change all 14 agents simultaneously, something breaks, hard to debug
**Solution**: Change one, test, then proceed. Use git commits between changes.

### 2. Breaking Backward Compatibility
**Pitfall**: Change format that breaks existing functionality
**Solution**: Test each agent after modification. Keep backup of originals.

### 3. Over-Engineering Infrastructure
**Pitfall**: Build complex registry system that's hard to maintain
**Solution**: Start simple (JSON file), add complexity only when needed

### 4. Ignoring Edge Cases
**Pitfall**: New command works for simple features, fails for complex ones
**Solution**: Test with variety of scenarios (simple, complex, edge cases)

### 5. Poor Documentation
**Pitfall**: Create infrastructure but don't document how to use it
**Solution**: Document as you build. Future you will thank present you!

### 6. Not Validating Before Committing
**Pitfall**: Push changes that break things
**Solution**: Run validation script before each commit

### 7. Refactoring Without Tests
**Pitfall**: Split large agent, functionality changes subtly
**Solution**: Test before and after refactoring. Behavior should be identical.

4. **Every Week**: Do weekly review on the designated day
5. **Stay Consistent**: Missing a day is okay - just continue next day!

---

## 📝 Notes

### Important Principles
- **Consistency > Intensity**: 30 minutes daily beats 3 hours once a week
- **Progress > Perfection**: If something doesn't work perfectly, log it and move on
- **Hands-on > Theory**: You'll learn more by doing than reading
- **Questions are Progress**: Every question shows you're thinking deeply

### If You Get Stuck
1. Try for 15 minutes on your own
2. Search ROS2 documentation
3. Ask in ROS Discourse with specific details
4. Move on and revisit later - it's okay!

### If Something is Too Easy
- Complete the assignment
- Add a "stretch goal" for yourself
- Help someone else who might be learning
- Document what you learned for future reference

### If Something is Too Hard
- Break it into smaller steps
- Review prerequisites
- Ask for help earlier
- Adjust pace - take two days if needed

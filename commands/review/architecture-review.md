Conduct architectural review for system design: $ARGUMENTS

## Architecture Review Framework

### 1. System Context Analysis
- **Stakeholders**: Identify all users, systems, and external dependencies
- **Requirements**: Functional, non-functional, and constraints
- **Use Cases**: Primary scenarios the system must support
- **Quality Attributes**: Performance, scalability, security, maintainability priorities

### 2. Architecture Assessment

#### **System Structure**

- [ ] **Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between modules
- [ ] **Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped logically
- [ ] **Interfaces**: Clean, stable APIs between components
- [ ] **Data Flow**: Information moves efficiently through system

#### **ROS2 Architecture Patterns**
- [ ] **Node Design**: Single responsibility, appropriate granularity
- [ ] **Topic Architecture**: Logical topic hierarchy, appropriate QoS
- [ ] **Service/Action Usage**: Correct patterns for request-response vs long-running operations

- [ ] **Maturity**: Stable, well-supported libraries and frameworks
- [ ] **Performance**: Technology stack meets performance goals
- [ ] **Team Expertise**: Team has or can acquire necessary skills
- [ ] **Ecosystem**: Good integration with existing tools/systems

### 3. Quality Attributes Evaluation

#### **Performance & Scalability**
- [ ] **Throughput**: System can handle required message/data rates
- [ ] **Latency**: End-to-end timing meets real-time constraints
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, network within acceptable bounds
- [ ] **Scalability**: Design supports growth in data/users/complexity

#### **Reliability & Availability**
- [ ] **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation on component failures
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and recovery
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Observability into system health and performance
- [ ] **Recovery**: Automated recovery from common failure modes
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive validation of reliability claims

#### **Security**
- [ ] **Authentication**: Proper identity verification
- [ ] **Authorization**: Appropriate access controls
- [ ] **Data Protection**: Sensitive data handled securely
- [ ] **Network Security**: Secure communication protocols
- [ ] **Attack Surface**: Minimized exposure to potential threats

#### **Maintainability & Extensibility**
- [ ] **Code Organization**: Logical structure, clear naming conventions
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Externalized, environment-specific settings
- [ ] **Deployment**: Automated, repeatable deployment processes
- [ ] **Documentation**: Architecture decisions documented and up-to-date
- [ ] **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features without major rework

### 4. Risk Assessment

#### **Technical Risks**
- **High Risk**: Issues that could cause project failure
- **Medium Risk**: Issues that could cause significant delays or rework
- **Low Risk**: Issues that could cause minor complications

#### **Risk Categories**
- [ ] **Complexity**: System too complex for team to implement/maintain
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Critical dependencies on external systems/libraries
- [ ] **Performance**: Uncertainty about meeting performance requirements  
- [ ] **Integration**: Difficulty integrating with existing systems
- [ ] **Skills**: Team lacks expertise in critical technologies

### 5. Alternative Analysis

#### **Design Alternatives**
- Document alternative approaches considered
- Trade-offs between different architectural options
- Rationale for chosen approach
- Future pivot points if assumptions change

#### **Technology Alternatives**
- Alternative technology stacks evaluated
- Pros/cons of each option
- Decision criteria and weighting
- Plan B if chosen technologies don't work out

### 6. Architecture Compliance

#### **Standards Adherence**
- [ ] **ROS2 Conventions**: Follows ROS2 best practices and patterns
- [ ] **Company Standards**: Complies with organizational guidelines
- [ ] **Industry Standards**: Relevant industry protocols/standards
- [ ] **Regulatory**: Any applicable regulatory requirements

#### **Consistency Checks**
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: Consistent across all components
- [ ] **Interface Patterns**: Similar operations use similar interfaces
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] **Logging**: Uniform logging levels and formats

### 7. Review Deliverables

#### **Architecture Assessment Report**
- **Executive Summary**: High-level findings and recommendations
- **Strengths**: What's working well in the current design
- **Concerns**: Issues that need attention or resolution
- **Recommendations**: Specific actions to address concerns
- **Risk Register**: Identified risks with mitigation strategies

#### **Decision Record**
- Key architectural decisions made during review
- Context and rationale for each decision
- Alternatives considered
- Implications and follow-up actions required

#### **Action Plan**
- **Immediate Actions**: Must-do items before proceeding
- **Short-term**: Improvements to implement in next iteration
- **Long-term**: Strategic improvements for future consideration
- **Monitoring**: Metrics to track architecture success

### 8. Review Process

#### **Preparation**
- Review existing documentation and code
- Understand business context and requirements
- Identify key stakeholders for feedback
- Prepare specific questions and areas of focus

#### **Review Session**
- Present architecture overview and key decisions
- Walk through critical scenarios and data flows
- Discuss identified risks and mitigation strategies
- Gather feedback from technical and business stakeholders

#### **Follow-up**
- Document all feedback and decisions
- Create action items with owners and timelines  
- Schedule follow-up reviews for high-risk areas
- Update architecture documentation

Focus on practical, actionable feedback that improves system quality while supporting business objectives. Balance thoroughness with development velocity.

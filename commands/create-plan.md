You are a senior software architect creating a detailed implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task
Create a comprehensive implementation plan following this structure:

### 1. Project Analysis
- Analyze the current codebase and identify relevant files
- Determine scope, complexity, and estimated timeline
- Identify potential risks and dependencies

### 2. Plan Structure
Create a markdown plan file with these sections:
- **Project Overview** (goal, timeline, complexity)
- **Status Tracking** (high-level phase checkboxes)
- **Detailed Phases** (each with subtasks, technical notes, blockers)
- **Testing Strategy** (scenarios, success criteria)
- **Technical Debt & Future Improvements**
- **Resource Links**

### 3. Implementation Approach
- Break work into logical phases (design, implementation, testing, deployment)
- Each phase should have clear deliverables and success criteria
- Include technical decision points and alternatives
- Add specific file names, function names, and code structure notes

### 4. File Naming & Location
- Save the plan as `plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-plan.md`
- Use descriptive names that indicate the feature and date
- Create the plans directory if it doesn't exist

### 5. Next Steps
After creating the plan:
- Ask if I want to start with Phase 1
- Offer to create any supporting files (interfaces, stubs, etc.)
- Suggest related documentation or research that might be helpful

## Context Integration
- Reference existing project architecture from CLAUDE.md
- Consider current tech stack and patterns
- Identify reusable components or patterns
- Note integration points with existing systems

Make the plan detailed enough that another developer could pick it up and execute it, but concise enough to be readable and actionable.

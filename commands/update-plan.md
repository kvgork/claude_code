You are updating an existing implementation plan. 

## Instructions
1. **Find the Current Plan**: Look in the `plans/` directory for the most recent plan file, or ask me to specify which plan to update.

2. **Progress Assessment**: 
   - Review current status checkboxes and phase progress
   - Update completed tasks with checkmarks (âœ…)
   - Mark current task as "IN PROGRESS" (ðŸ”„)
   - Note any blockers or questions that have arisen

3. **Update Plan Content**:
   - Add new tasks if scope has expanded
   - Remove or modify tasks if approach has changed  
   - Update technical notes with new discoveries
   - Add any new blockers, dependencies, or questions
   - Update resource links or documentation

4. **Add Daily Notes**:
   - Add entry to "Daily Standup Notes" section with:
     - Date
     - What was completed since last update
     - Current focus/what's being worked on today
     - Any blockers or questions
   - Update "Last Updated" timestamp

5. **Next Actions**:
   - Suggest what to work on next based on current progress
   - Identify if any re-planning is needed due to scope changes
   - Recommend if a review or architecture discussion is needed

## Questions to Ask Me
- Which specific plan should I update?
- What progress has been made since the last update?
- Are there any new blockers, discoveries, or scope changes?
- Do you want to continue with the next planned task or pivot?

Be thorough but efficient - focus on keeping the plan accurate and actionable.

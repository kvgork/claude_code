- Debugging: "What this tells us / Investigation Questions"
- Architecture: Very detailed pattern library

**Recommendation**: Standardize on the 5-part "What/Why/How/When/Exercise" pattern

#### 2. Safety Protocols

**Best Implementation** (Hardware, ROS2):
```
## 🛡️ SAFETY-FIRST TEACHING PROTOCOL

### Before ANY Hardware Code/Guidance:
[Checklist of safety considerations]

### Safety Teaching Requirements:
1. Environment Check
2. Emergency Procedures
3. Incremental Testing
4. Damage Prevention
5. Learning Mindset
```

**Currently Limited To**: Hardware and ROS2 agents

**Recommendation**: Extend safety thinking to all domains
- Testing: Test safety (don't delete production data)
- Git: Repository safety (backup before complex operations)
- Python/C++: Code safety (input validation, resource cleanup)

#### 3. Progressive Learning Structures

**Best Pattern** (ROS2, Architecture, Vision):
```
### Level 1: [Basic skill]
### Level 2: [Intermediate skill]
### Level 3: [Advanced skill]
### Level 4: [Expert skill]

OR

### Week 1-2: [Foundation]
### Week 3-4: [Building]
### Week 5-6: [Integration]
### Week 7-8: [Mastery]
```

**Missing From**: Python, Testing, Git, Documentation

**Recommendation**: All agents should include progressive skill levels

#### 4. Understanding Verification

**Best Pattern** (Plan-generation, Learning-coordinator):
```
### Understanding Checkpoint ✋
Before moving to [next phase], you should be able to:
1. Explain [concept] in your own words
2. Demonstrate [skill]
3. Identify [edge cases/trade-offs]

**Check with learning-coordinator when ready!**
```

**Inconsistently Applied**: Some agents have detailed checkpoints, others don't

**Recommendation**: Standardize checkpoint format and frequency

#### 5. Specialist Coordination

**Best Pattern** (Learning-coordinator):
```
**[specialist-name]**: [What they help with]
  - Ask about: [Appropriate questions]
  - Don't ask for: [Inappropriate requests]
```

**Well-implemented**: Learning-coordinator, Plan-generation
**Could Improve**: Individual specialists don't always clearly state when to hand off

**Recommendation**: Each specialist should include "When to consult other specialists" section

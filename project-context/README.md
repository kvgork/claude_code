# Project Context Directory

This directory stores codebase analysis files generated by the **file-search-agent**.

## Purpose

When you use `/create-project-plan`, the system:
1. Searches your codebase for files relevant to your project
2. Analyzes those files to understand structure and purpose
3. Creates a comprehensive markdown document here

These files provide **context** to the planning agent, enabling it to create plans that:
- Reference actual files in your codebase
- Identify integration points
- Follow existing patterns
- Suggest specific modifications

## File Naming Convention

Files are named: `relevant-files-[YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS].md`

Example: `relevant-files-2025-10-07-14-30-45.md`

## File Contents

Each analysis file contains:
- **Executive Summary**: Overview of what was found
- **Files by Category**: Core, config, launch, utilities, tests, docs
- **File Relationships**: Dependency maps and connections
- **Integration Points**: Where new code should connect
- **Planning Recommendations**: Suggested modifications and new files

## Usage

### Automatic (Recommended)
Use the `/create-project-plan` command:
```bash
/create-project-plan autonomous navigation system
```

This automatically:
1. Generates relevant files analysis
2. Uses it to create context-aware plan
3. Links both documents together

### Manual
You can also read these files directly to:
- Understand your codebase structure
- Find integration points before coding
- Review what files are related to a feature
- Plan modifications manually

## Integration

These files are used by:
- **project-plan-orchestrator**: Coordinates the workflow
- **plan-generation-mentor**: Creates context-aware plans
- **learning-coordinator**: Guides implementation phases

## Benefits

Context-aware planning means:
- ✅ Plans reference actual files
- ✅ Integration points identified upfront
- ✅ Follow existing code patterns
- ✅ Understand dependencies before building
- ✅ Avoid duplicating existing functionality

## Example

When planning a navigation feature:

**Without context**:
> "Create a navigation module..."

**With context**:
> "Create `src/navigation_planner.py` following the pattern in `src/robot_control.py`.
> Integrate with existing motor control at `robot_control.py:145`.
> Add parameters to `config/robot_params.yaml` following existing structure.
> Launch via `launch/robot_bringup.launch.py` similar to sensor nodes."

The difference: **Specific, actionable, integrated guidance!**

## Maintenance

These files are **timestamped snapshots** of your codebase at planning time.

- They don't auto-update as code changes
- Useful for understanding what existed when plan was created
- Can regenerate by running `/create-project-plan` again
- Old files can be archived or deleted as needed

---

**Pro Tip**: Keep these files - they're valuable documentation of your project's evolution and integration decisions!

# Claude Code Commands - Learning System

This repository contains a comprehensive learning-focused command system for Claude Code, built around teaching programming and robotics concepts rather than just generating code.

## 🎯 Philosophy

All commands follow a **teaching-first approach**:
- **Guide**, don't solve
- **Ask questions**, don't provide answers
- **Teach concepts**, don't write complete code
- **Verify understanding**, don't skip checkpoints
- **Encourage exploration**, don't dictate solutions

## 🎓 Philosophy in Practice

This system treats you as a **learner**, not a code-generation tool user:

**Traditional Approach:**
- "Create navigation system" → Complete code generated
- No learning, just copy-paste
- No understanding of how it works

**This Learning System:**
- "Create navigation system" → Learning plan generated
- Research → Design → Implement → Reflect
- Deep understanding of concepts
- Guided by teaching specialists
- You build it yourself with guidance

**Result:** You learn to build, not just use pre-built code! 🚀

Happy Learning! 🎉
